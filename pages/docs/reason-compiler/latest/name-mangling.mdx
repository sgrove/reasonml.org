There are times when you might need to use one of the [reserved keywords](/docs/manual/latest/reserved-keywords) in your code.

## Using reserved keywords as JSX props

Many React components have a prop named `type` in JavaScript:

```js
/* this won't work in Reason since `type` is a reserved keyword! */
<Component type="title" />
```

If you're using a React component with a reserved keyword as a prop name, then simply prepend a underscore (so that it's a valid Reason name):

```reason
/* This works because `_type` is not a reserved keyword */
<Component _type="title" />
```

The Reason compiler will remove the trailing underscore when outputting JavaScript (so the JavaScript will have `<Component type="POST" />`)

## Accessing JavaScript object attributes that start with a capital letter

Capital letters in reason are used exclusively for module names, like `String` and `Belt`, and they cannot be used as record field names like in JavaScript.

```js
const payload = {
  PostTitle: "Welcome to Reason",
};

/* this won't work in Reason since `PostTitle` is capitalized, so `paylod.PostTitle` would break */
const title = payload.PostTitle;
```

In this case, when writing bindings to the JavaScript object, you can use the `[@bs.as "whatever-name-you-want-in-javascript"]` to tell the compiler exactly what the JavaScript attribute name should be in the compiled output:

```reason
type payload = {
    [@bs.as "PostTitle"]
    postTitle: string
};

let payload = {
    postTitle: "Welcome to Reason"
};

/* Reason is happy since we're using the valid `postTitle` field name */
let title = payload.postTitle;
```

The reason compiler will output the JavaScript for `title` as:

```js
/* The correct capitalized field name is output in the JavaScript! */
var title = payload.PostTitle;
```

## Accessing reserved keywords as JavaScript object attribute names

Just like accessing attributes that start with a capital letter, we can use `[@bs.as "the-reserved-keyword-that-javascript-wants"]`. It's customary to append an underscore (just like the JSX case) to the reserved keyword name:

```reason
type payload {
    [@bs.as "type"]
    type_: string
}

let payload = {
    type_: "Documentation"
}

/* Reason is happy since we're using the valid `type_` field name */
let payloadType = payload.type_;
```

The reason compiler will output the JavaScript for `payloadType` as:

```js
/* The reason compiler has correctly ouput `payload.type` even though *we* called the field `type_` */
var payloadType = payload.type;
```

## Warning accessing a JavaScript object field names in a structural way [Advanced]

When accessing a JavaScript object field in a structural way (e.g. `myJsObject##some`), the following rules apply:

1. A single _leading_ underscore will be dropped from the output: `myJsObject##_type` => `myJsObject.type`
1. Double (or more) _leading_ underscores will kept in the output: `myJsObject##__type` => `myJsObject.__type`
1. There is _no way_ to access e.g. `myJsObject##_type` structurally - use records and `[@bs.as "_type"]` instead
1. The _final trailing_ double underscores (and anything following them) will be dropped from the output: `myJsObject##this_is_kept__this_is_omitted` => `myJsObject.this_is_kept`
